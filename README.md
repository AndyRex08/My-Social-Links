## My process

Started out with the HTML body part and worked my way down to the attribution section. Had the CSS section done side by side with the HTML thereby making it easier to track changes and progress through my work.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Actually got more clearance on Flexbox and had to read/lookup Grid system too, learnt how both works and would see which one is easier to use in subsequent challenges.


### Continued development

Think i'll keep working on it to make it better and achieve a more responsive site across all device.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://fonts.google.com/selection) - Figured it's easier using/adding the google version of the font to my project.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
